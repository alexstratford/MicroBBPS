# MicroBBPS
<h3>Breadboard Power Supply</h3>
<BR CLEAR=”left” />

A small, USB-C connected power supply designed to fit onto the power rails of a solderless breadboard.

For each side, you can select between 3.3 & 5.0 Volt linear regulators, or the input voltage at the screw terminal. 

The integrated version adds 26 breadboard rows and 2 continuous power rails. So you can turn those prototypes into something more permanent with an easy microUSB power connector.

## Development
This open source hardware project is developed using KiCAD and inkscape. It exists as a schematic and pcb design, with supporting files to create the necesarry output files for Printed Circuit Board fabrication.

## Status

Assemblies and Parts Kits are still available to purchase on Tindie, however current stock is starting to run low.

The PCBA is currently at Revision A02. The tag for this release contians all the design files as they were when fabrication files were generated.

### A02 Fabrication

After incorporating the design changes from the first revision, the second revision came out great! 

There are still a few details to try and adjust for any future fabrication.
- Silkscreen adjustments for better image fidelity
- Still have some mechanical rocking on the solderless version when inserted into a breadboard

Some of the major changes between on A02 from A01 are
- Smaller board shape
- Changed LEDs to 1206 for better part availability and easier hand soldering
- Larger silkscreen features
- Integrated version

### A01 Fabrication
Here are some photos of the first board revision
