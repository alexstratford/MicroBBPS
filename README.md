# MicroBBPS 
<h3>Breadboard Powersupply</h3>

A selectable power supply perfect for powering experimental circuits with a micro USB cable or with a 20V max DC screw terminal.

Select between LDO Linear regulated 3.3V, 5V, or Screw Terminal input.

The integrated version adds 26 breadboard rows and 2 continuous power rails. Turn those prototypes into something more permanent with an easy microUSB power connector. 

## Development
This open source hardware project is developed using KiCAD and inkscape. It exists as a schematic and pcb design, with supporting files to create the necesarry output files for Printed Circuit Board fabrication.

## Status

This project is under active development, with a focus shifting to documentaion.
The PCBA is currently at Revision A02 with boards and parts on order.

I plan on attempting to make A02 boards available to purchase on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/stasis/)
