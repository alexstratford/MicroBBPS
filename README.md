# MicroBBPS
<h3>Breadboard Power Supply</h3>
<BR CLEAR=”left” />

A small, USB-C connected power supply designed to fit onto the power rails of a solderless breadboard.

For each side, you can select between 3.3 & 5.0 Volt linear regulators, or the input voltage at the screw terminal. 

The integrated version adds 26 breadboard rows and 2 continuous power rails. So you can turn those prototypes into something more permanent with an easy microUSB power connector.

## Development
This open source hardware project is developed using KiCAD and inkscape. It exists as a schematic and pcb design, with supporting files to create the necesarry output files for Printed Circuit Board fabrication.

### A02 Fabrication

After incorporating the design changes from the first revision, the second revision came out great! 

There are still a few details to try and adjust for any future fabrication.
- Silkscreen adjustments for better image fidelity
- Still have some mechanical rocking on the solderless version when inserted into a breadboard

Some of the major changes between on A02 from A01 are
- Smaller board shape
- Changed LEDs to 1206 for better part availability and easier hand soldering
- Larger silkscreen features
- Integrated version
